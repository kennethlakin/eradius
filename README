This is an alpha quality RADIUS/EAP server.

It currently supports EAP-MD5, EAP-MSCHAPv2, and PEAPv0/1-MSCHAPv2.

It shares no code with and is related only in function to the travelping/jungerl
project of the same name.

It has been tested with eapol_test, OS X 10.10.5, Windows 7, and a couple of
Android devices.

Getting started:
* Install rebar3 and put it on your PATH.
* Copy app.config.example to app.config
  * The contents of the eradius ssl_opts list are passed to ssl:ssl_accept/2. Modify
    the list as required to point to your SSL certificates and include any password
    required to unlock them.
* Copy credentials.example to credentials
* Run make (or rebar3 compile) to fetch deps and build the project.
* Run "make start" to start the server. Run "make watch" to start the server
  as well as rustyio's sync auto-recompiler.

Dependencies:
* Erlang 18 or later
* lager
* lager_syslog
* sync
rebar3 handles dependency fetching and compilation.

Known issues:
* The project contains a patched copy of the ssl application from
  OTP 18.3. Patches applied are the "Use negotiated PRF for ssl:prf"
  patch that has landed in OTP 19 and the "Add three-way toggle for
  BEAST mitigation strategy" patch that is currently under consideration.
  The patches are in patches/ if you wish to apply them to a different
  version of the ssl application.
* Loglevels are somewhat inappropriate.
* Too little validation is done on incoming data.
* Listen port is hard-coded.
* RADIUS packet handler crashes rather than sending an Access-Reject if sent
  a non-EAP packet.
* Very little validation is performed on PEAP packets. No validation is
  performed on TLS payloads in PEAP packets.
* TLS messages transmited by the NAS that are split across multiple RADIUS
  packets will not be handled correctly. The PEAP handling code needs to
  check for this condition and accumulate the complete TLS packet before
  sending it off to the TLS handler.
