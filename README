This is an alpha quality RADIUS/EAP server.

It currently supports EAP-MD5, EAP-MSCHAPv2, and PEAPv0/1-MSCHAPv2.

It shares no code with and is related only in function to the travelping/jungerl
project of the same name.

It has been tested with eapol_test, OS X 10.10.5, Windows 7, and a couple of
Android devices.

Getting started:
* Install rebar3 and put it on your PATH.
* Copy app.config.example to app.config
  * The contents of the eradius ssl_opts list are passed to ssl:ssl_accept/2. Modify
    the list as required to point to your SSL certificates and include any password
    required to unlock them.
* Copy credentials.example to credentials
* Run make (or rebar3 compile) to fetch deps and build the project.
* Run "make start" to start the server. Run "make watch" to start the server
  as well as rustyio's sync auto-recompiler.

Dependencies:
* Erlang 19 or later (See "Version Notes" to run on Erlang 18)
* lager
* lager_syslog
* sync
rebar3 handles dependency fetching and compilation.

Known issues:
* Loglevels are somewhat inappropriate.
* Too little validation is done on incoming data.
* Listen port is hard-coded.
* RADIUS packet handler crashes rather than sending an Access-Reject if sent
  a non-EAP packet.
* Very little validation is performed on PEAP packets. No validation is
  performed on TLS payloads in PEAP packets.
* TLS messages transmited by the NAS that are split across multiple RADIUS
  packets will not be handled correctly. The PEAP handling code needs to
  check for this condition and accumulate the complete TLS packet before
  sending it off to the TLS handler.

Version Notes:
OTP 19 contains the two patches required to make EAP-TLS function correctly.
If you need to run on an earlier version of OTP, the patches directory contains
patches that can be applied to OTP 18's ssl application. The directory also
contains a tarball that is the OTP 18.3 ssl application with these patches applied.
To use the patched ssl application, unpack the tarball in the apps directory, then
see commit 4773cb5 for the Makefile changes required to load the patched ssl
application in preference to the OTP ssl application.

All code in the project is released under the terms of the GPLv2 or later,
with the exception of the bundled OTP ssl application. That code (and the
patches applied to it) is released under the terms of the Apache License
